## New Clues

This is the HTML version of the "New Clues" page  by David Weinberger and Doc Searls to be posted sometime in early January 2015 at http://www.cluetrain.com/newclues/index.html. These documents are currently in stealth mode. We're trusting you with this.

The text of the New Clues page is posted under a Creative Commons 0 license that puts them into the public domain. Use them as you would like. (Obviously, it would be polite to credit the authors and  link back to the original site. )

The files:

- clues_.html: The 122 clues, in divs with ids indicating their number. This includes the section and subsection headings as well. In the original page, there are three main sections, each with subsections prefaced by letters that start again at "a" for each of the sections. Each sections contains clues that are numbered consecuetively from the beginning of the document, 1-135.

- preamble_.html: The preamble to the newclues page.

- clues_.txt: A pure text version of the clues. The clues are preceded by their number on a separate line. The subsection headings are preceded by a letter. The major sections are preceded by a roman numeral.

- clues_.json: A JSON version of the clues. Just the text of the clues. No preamble. No numbers. No subheads or hierarchy. No links.

- newclues_.json: A JSON version of all the text, including the preamble, all the clues,  the chapter heads and subtitles, and their hierarchy.

We look forward to the use you put these to.
