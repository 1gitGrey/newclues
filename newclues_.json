	"Hear, O Internet.",
	"It has been fifteen years since our previous communication.",
	"In that time the People of the Internet — you and me and all our friends of friends of friends, unto the last Kevin Bacon — have made the Internet an awesome place, filled with wonders and portents.",
	"From the serious to the lolworthy to the wtf, we have up-ended titans, created heroes,  and changed the most basic assumptions about",
	"How Things Work and Who We Are.",
	"But now all the good work we've done together faces mortal dangers.",
	"When we first came before you, it was to warn of the threat posed by those who did not understand that they did not understand the Internet.",
	"These are The Fools, and they are with us still, although many have by now adopted the trappings of the Internet. They are like unto aging baby boomers wearing their baseball caps backwards. It's just embarrassing.",
	"Now two more hordes threaten all that we have built for one another.",
	"The Marauders understand the Internet all too well. They view it as theirs to plunder, extracting our money and data from it, thinking that we are the fools.",
	"Then there is the horde of our own Evil Inclinations. We give in to this eternal aspect of our nature when we too easily exchange the truly valuable for the merely shiny — and then we sit back complicitly as the Fools and Marauders amplify the very worst of what we are.",
	"Make no mistake: We can lose the Internet we love with a stroke of a pen, a covert handshake, or by allowing memes to drown out the cries of the afflicted.",
	"We come to you from the years of the Web's beginning. We have grown old together on the Internet. Time is short.",
	"We, the People of the Internet, need to remember the glory of its revelation so that we reclaim it now in the name of what it truly is."

				{"clue" : "The first among these is: Thy network shall move all packets closer to their destinations without favor or delay based on origin, source, content, or intent."},
				{"clue" : "Thus does this First Commandment lay open the Internet to every idea, application, business, quest, vice and whatever."},
				{"clue" : "There has not been a tool with such a general purpose since language."},
				{"clue" : "This means the Internet is not for anything special or in particular. Not for social networking, not for documents, not for advertising, not for business, not for education, not for porn, not for anything. It is specifically designed for everything."},

				{"clue" : "Did we use the word \"content\" without quotes? We feel so dirty."},
				{"clue" : "The word \"content\" takes crap intended to sound like it was written by someone who cares — you know, one of us — and puts it into the same linguistic bin as a teenager's unrequited love note, the blissful release of a long-kept secret, a fine sketch drawn by a palsied hand, a blog post in a regime that hates the sound of its people's voices."},

				{"clue" : "In the classical sense, anything that alters or affects a message passing through a medium is noise. A good medium passes its messages with the least interference."},
				{"clue" : "So, what passes messages on the Internet? You and me, sisters and brothers. We move messages every time we tweet or retweet, send a link in an email, or post it on a social network."},
				{"clue" : "Unlike a medium, you and I leave our fingerprints, and sometimes bite marks, on the messages we pass. We tell people why we're sending it. We argue with it. We add a joke. We chop off the part we don't like. We make these messages our own."},

				{"clue" : "That sounds familiar. Oh, yeah, that's what the world is."},

				{"clue" : "Demonization of 'them' — people with looks, languages, opinions, memberships and other groupings we don't understand, like, or tolerate — is worse than ever on the Internet."},

				{"clue" : "We can say this much: Hatred didn't call the Net into existence, but it is holding the Net — and us — back."},
				{"clue" : "Let's at least acknowledge that the Net has values implicit in it. Human values."},

				{"clue" : "We do this in part because conversation requires a common ground: shared language, interests, norms, understandings. Without those, it's hard or even impossible to have a conversation."},
				{"clue" : "Shared grounds spawn tribes. The literal ground kept tribes at a distance, enabling them to develop rich differences. Rejoice! Tribes give rise to demonization and war. Rejoice? Not so much."},
				{"clue" : "On the Internet, the distance among tribes starts at zero."},
				{"clue" : "Apparently knowing how to find one another interesting is not as easy as it looks."},

				{"clue" : "Don't worry: we'll tell you when we're in the market for something. In our own way. Not yours. Trust us: this will be good for you."},
				{"clue" : "Does Internet advertising work? Wrong question."},
				{"clue" : "The right question is, do ads make the place better or worse?"},
				{"clue" : "Some are better than others. And some are a whole lot worse."},
				{"clue" : "Brand advertising could be annoying, but at least it didn't pretend to be a personal message whispered in our ear."},
				{"clue" : "Also: It didn't dress itself up as news in the hope we'll miss the little disclaimer hanging off its underwear."},
				{"clue" : "When personalizing something is creepy, it's a pretty good indication that you don't understand what it means to be a person."},
				{"clue" : "But then, maybe \"you\" isn't a human. Maybe you're just a big machine, crunching big data, using algorithms to guess about people. Are you listening, machine? Didn't think so."},
				{"clue" : "Personal is human. Personalized isn't."},
				{"clue" : "The difference is voice. Humans have have real ones. Machines don't. The more human machines sound, the more they slide down into the uncanny valley where everything is a creep show."},
				{"clue" : "The only thing worse: When marketing machines actually do sound human. We may buy your crap, but at the price of an erosion of human trust. So, thanks for that."},
				{"clue" : "Advertisers got along without being creepy for generations. They can get along without being creepy on the Net, too."},
				{"clue" : "When you make your ad sound like it came from a friendly human when it actually comes from your marketing department's irritable bowels, you're staining the fabric of the Web."},
				{"clue" : "When you place a \"native ad,\" you're eroding not just your own trustworthiness, but the trustworthiness of this entire new way of being with one another."},
				{"clue" : "And, by the way, how about calling \"native ads\" by any of their real names: \"product placement,\" \"advertorial,\" or \"fake fuckinggosh darn news\"?"},
				{"clue" : "Also, please note that \"trying to be authentic\" makes as much sense as \"trying to be effortless.\""},
				{"clue" : "Maybe \"corporations are people, my friend\" (no, they're not) but are you telling us that they can be authentic people? Really?"},
				{"clue" : "So, here's Rule #1 for Internet advertisers: Quit pretending to be human. Just be your selves. We like you better that way."},
