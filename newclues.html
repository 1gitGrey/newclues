communication</a>. </p> <p class="intro"> In that time the People of the Internet — you and me and all our friends of friends of friends, unto the last Kevin Bacon — have made the Internet an awesome place, filled with wonders and portents. </p>                  <p class="intro">From the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">serious</a> to the <a href="http://lolcatbible.com">lolworthy</a> to the <a href="http://www.truthforhumanity.com/">wtf</a>, we have up-ended titans, created heroes,&nbsp; and changed the most basic assumptions about<br> How Things Work and Who We Are. </p>                  <p class="intro">But now all the good work we've done together faces mortal dangers.</p>                  <p class="intro indent0">When we first came before you, it was to warn of the threat posed by those who did not understand that they did not understand the Internet.</p>                  <p class="intro indent0">These are The Fools, and they are with us still, although many have by now adopted the trappings of the Internet. They are like unto aging baby boomers wearing their baseball caps backwards. It's just embarrassing.</p>                  <p class="intro indent0">Now two more hordes threaten all that we have built for one another.</p>                  <p class="intro indent0">The Marauders understand the Internet all too well. They view it as theirs to plunder, extracting our money and data from it, thinking that we are the fools.</p>                  <p class="intro indent0">Then there is the horde of our own Evil Inclinations. We give in to this eternal aspect of our nature when we too easily exchange the truly valuable for the merely shiny — and then we sit back complicitly as the Fools and Marauders amplify the very worst of what we are. </p>                  <p class="intro indent0">Make no mistake: We can lose the Internet we love with a stroke of a pen, a covert handshake, or by allowing memes to drown out the cries of the afflicted.</p>                  <p class="intro indent0">We come to you from the years of the Web's beginning. We have grown old together on the Internet. Time is short.</p>                  <p class="intro indent0">We, the People of the Internet, need to remember the glory of its revelation so that we reclaim it now in the name of what it truly is. </p>                  <p class="byline"> <em><span id="author1"></span> <br>                      <span id="author2"></span></em>                        <br /><span style="font-size: 0.8em">January 1, 2015</span></p>                                     </div>                <!-- =========== CLUES ============ -->                <div id="clueswrapper">                  <!-- ====== CHAPTER 1 -->                  <div class="chapter"> <span class="chapternumb"></span> <span                      class="chaptertext">                      <span style="font-size: 2.0em; font-weight:200">O</span>nce

The media saw it as a new way of publishing, and businesses saw it as a new ways to sell us stuff. Meanwhile, the rest of us were getting to know one another, were inventing things, and were having a party. </p>                    <p class="about">Four of us got so annoyed by the insistence on misunderstanding the Net that we tried to spell it out in 95 theses that we posted as the <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com">Cluetrain  Manifesto</a>. </p>                    <p class="about">That Manifesto had four authors: Doc Searls and David Weinberger who wrote these new clues, and Christopher Locke and Rick Levine. We four also wrote a book called The Cluetrain Manifesto that became a business best-seller. You can read the entire original book <a href="http://cluetrain.com/book/index.html">online
                        for free</a>. (We did a <a href="http://cluetrain.com/Cluetrain_10/">tenth
                        anniversary edition</a> in 2011 that has all the original content plus lots of reflections on how things have changed.) </p>                    <p class="about"> Chris writes and cogitates in Boulder. Rick and his brother have Kickstarted a very cool sock company, <a href="http://xoab.us">XOAB</a>. </p>                    <p class="about">Doc and David have independently written a number of books (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Intention_Economy">Doc</a> | <a href="http://www.johotheblog.com">David</a>) about the Internet. They have also been fellows at the Harvard <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu">Berkman</a> Center for Internet &amp; Society. Doc has been the leader of the <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Main_Page">VRM</a> parade. Until recently, David co-directed the Harvard Library Innovation Lab. In Feb. 2015, he'll be a fellow at Harvard's Shorenstein Center, and will be teaching at Emerson College. Both Doc and David have families, lives, etc., and like long walks on the beach and snuggling under blankets on chilly evenings.</p>                    <p class="about" id="thankyou">Thanks to our friends and idols who read early drafts, commented, argued, found holes, poked holes, and encouraged us.
